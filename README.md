### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
![GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=aivan33&show_icons=true)  

Full-stack developer and data geek, building a solid foundation on which to innovate the digital space I believe in. My expertise is in mathematics, statistics and computer science. Currently, I'm leveraging those skills for building my passion projects [] and gain insight into the fascinating world of ML.

I started off as assistant to the Project Manager and later Brand Manager of a creative studio - DLL, where I gained experience in building projects from the ground up and managing a team. All my projects are build from the ground up, from the planning, through the design and development. See those in my Portfolio and learn more about my transition from a creative field to a techincal one in my blog []
